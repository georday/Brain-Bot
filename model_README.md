A quick note for those downloading the stl files.

Pieces have been split to enable printing on a (10 by 10 by 10) 3d printbed. 
	As such, pieces with similiar names and end in '_a#' should be glued or otherwise affixed. 
	It should be self evident how the pieces fit together when printed.

The outer diameter of the base is 5 inches.

I have not yet tried printing the parts. This readme will be updated when I do.
