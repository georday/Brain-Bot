# Brain-Bot

Project Brain-Bot/Thought-Bot, is aiming to create a simple, stationary robot to be controlled with a human interface device.
Assuming the Project goes to plan, it will have two degrees of freedom and a head to which modules can be affixed.

This is a public link to the Fusion 360 project for the base of the robot.

I will likely use a rasberry pi as the control computer, but I'll consider other options if the need arises.

The human interface device is an Emotiv Insight. It's an electroencephalography (EEG for convience) headset capable of detecting neural activity. The exact specifications of the
headset and the neural activity can be found at their website listed below.

***Please note, I am entirely unaffiliated with Emotiv.***

This readme will continue to be updated as I continue working on the project.
